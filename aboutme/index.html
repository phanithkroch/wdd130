    <h2>CHANPHANITH KROCH</h2>
    <p>My name is Phanith, I join BYU-Idaho because I want to pursue my education and develop my skills.
        I am pursuing a WDD in Web Development.
        I have been married for 5 months and I don't have kids. I work full-time as a graphic designer. 
        Learning about Web design can be a fulfilling and satisfying xperience. 
        I hope I can acquire the ability to create visually attractive, user-friendly, 
        and responsive website that are tailored to meet the needs of different businesses and audiences.
        I live in Phnom Penh, Cambodia. In my free time I like to play soccer with my friends. 
        I am a convert to the church and I've been member of the church since 2012.
